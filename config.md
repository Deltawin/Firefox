# ABOUT

**about:config** settings to harden the Firefox browser. Privacy and performance enhancements.</br>
To change these settings type 'about:config' in the url bar.
Then search the setting you would like to change and modify the value. Some settings may break certain websites from functioning and 
rendering normally. Some settings may also make firefox unstable.
### I am not liable for any damages/loss of data. 
	
Not all these changes are necessary and will be dependent upon your usage and hardware. Do some research on settings if you don't understand what they do. These settings are best combined with your standard privacy extensions 
(HTTPS Everywhere, NoScript/Request Policy, uBlock origin, agent spoofing, Privacy Badger etc), and all plugins set to "Ask To Activate".

**Some of these settings can actually make you more unique in some ways. There is a trade off.** Evaluate your browsers fingerprint:

You can check current connections the your browser is making via **about:networking**

# Flash Font Enumeration
This one is not for firefox, but for Flash if you have it installed.
Font Enumeration allows a site to read which fonts you have installed 
which can be used to identify users.

Default Location:	
```
Windows: 
	C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash\mms.cfg
	C:\Windows\system32\Macromed\Flash\mms.cfg
Linux:
	/etc/adobe/mms.cfg
OSX:
	~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Pepper Data/Shockwave Flash/System/mms.cfg
```

Add this line to the mms.cfg file:
```
DisableDeviceFontEnumeration = 1
```
**Better yet, simply uninstall flash. Flash is garbage...**

** I do my best to keep this list up to date. Additions and corrections are greatly appreciated. Some keys may not be listed and must be added manually, or they are no longer relavent as firefox changes. **
